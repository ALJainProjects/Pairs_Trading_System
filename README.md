# Advanced Pairs Trading System

An end-to-end algorithmic trading platform for researching, backtesting, and deploying pairs trading strategies. The system features a sophisticated Streamlit-based web interface, supports multiple strategy paradigms from statistical to deep learning models, and is designed for robust quantitative analysis.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is designed with a modular architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability:

- **UI Layer (`streamlit_system/`):** An interactive web interface built with Streamlit for managing the entire workflow without writing code.
- **Strategy & Backtesting Layer (`src/strategy/`):** Contains the logic for various trading strategies, a high-fidelity backtesting engine, and risk management modules.
- **Quantitative Analysis Layer (`src/analysis/`):** A suite of tools for statistical analysis, including pair selection through correlation, cointegration, and clustering.
- **Modeling Layer (`src/models/`):** Implements the statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models that drive the trading strategies.
- **Data Layer (`src/data/`):** Handles data acquisition from APIs and files, preprocessing, feature engineering, and database management.
- **Execution Layer (`execution/`):** Provides connectivity to brokers (e.g., Alpaca) for paper and live trading.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AJAllProjects/Pairs_Trading_System.git](https://github.com/AJAllProjects/Pairs_Trading_System.git)
    cd Pairs_Trading_System
    ```

2.  **Create Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    # It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4. **Setup Environment Variables**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the project root.
    - Copy the contents of `.env.example` into it and fill in your Alpaca paper trading API keys.

5.  **Set Up the Database**
    The database is created automatically on first run. To reset it, you can delete the `pair_trading.db` file.

### üñ•Ô∏è Running the System

1.  **Start the Streamlit Interface**
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_system/app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the Dashboard**
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## üìä Using the Platform

The platform is designed around a sequential workflow, accessible from the sidebar:

1.  **Data Loading:** Upload your own CSV files or download market data directly from sources like Yahoo Finance.
2.  **Pair Analysis:** Use correlation, cointegration, and clustering tools to identify promising pairs for trading.
3.  **Strategy Builder:** Select a strategy type (e.g., Statistical, ML), configure its parameters, and set risk management rules.
4.  **Backtest:** Run the configured strategy on the historical data to evaluate its performance.
5.  **Optimization:** Use advanced methods like Bayesian optimization to find the best parameters for your strategy.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

- **Database Settings:** Edit `config/settings.py` or set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
- **Logging:** Configure logging levels and formats in `config/logging_config.py`.
- **API Keys:** Store all secret keys in the `.env` file.
